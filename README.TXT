This Software is used to Glitch JPEG Images.

The idea for it came from Kevin Nally and I did just the implementation.
Our goal is to further the glitching community.
So feel free to write on GitHub or create an issue with a new feature for the DonegalGlitcher or
if you wanna help developing it feel free to contact me.

All the best

Installation

As before make a bat file for the jar file like:
"C:\Program files(x86\java\jre6\bin\java" -jar "C:\Users\Dietmar\Documents\NetBeansProjects\Glitcher\dist\DonegalGlitcher.jar"

and save it with a .bat extention

then just run the bat in a cmd window

It is a normal windows program, but a lot of information is output into the cmd window for debug purposes.
Regard this as Alpha, so no waranties :)

Tell me if you have any problems.

All the best
Dietmar
