Installation

As before make a bat file for the jar file like:
"C:\Program files(x86\java\jre6\bin\java" -jar "C:\Users\Dietmar\Documents\NetBeansProjects\Glitcher\dist\DonegalGlitcher.jar"

and save it with a .bat extention

then just run the bat in a cmd window

It is a normal windows program, but a lot of information is output into the cmd window for debug purposes.
Regard this as Alpha, so no waranties :)

Tell me if you have any problems.

All the best
Dietmar
